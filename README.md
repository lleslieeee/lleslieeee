# 🌐 Hey there!

I’m someone who enjoys learning new things, building small projects, and exploring different ideas.  
Most of what I do isn’t flashy, but I like keeping things simple and improving a little bit at a time.

## ✨ What I’m Into
- 🧪 Trying out new concepts and tinkering with random stuff  
- 💻 Messing around with tech, code, or tools just for fun  
- 📚 Learning at my own pace  
- 🎧 Music, relaxing, and vibing online

## 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here
- Small projects  
- Random experiments  
- Maybe some notes or ideas that I thought were cool  

Nothing too serious—just a space to explore.
